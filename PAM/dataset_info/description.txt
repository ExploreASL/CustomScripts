Dear Jan,

Attached you'll find some DICOM files. Some of them resulted in different names/structures of the nii files or the DICOMs themselves were structured differently. Hopefully this includes most options.

Here are some notes (if you need more explanation, please let me know):
01007-2: old protocol from server (different DICOM mapping)
Gives only mean deltaM without M0

02005-1: difference in names nii files
All repetitions of ASL - but weirdly grouped, with M0

03034 -2: difference in names nii files
PAR/REC that is duplicitous or DICOM dir that is duplicitous, inside, we can use what's there in directories identifiable by sequence name, but in ASL___SOURCE there are all the repetitions and there's also M0

01001-1: old protocol (and less DICOM files) - Single file per sequence and XX file all in one dir
All repetitions of ASL - but weirdly grouped, without M0

03034-1: normal DICOM mapping (30 items), and normal nii
Each sequence has a subdir, not able to identify by sequence name from the directory name
All repetitions of ASL - but weirdly grouped, with M0

01008-1: old protocol and different DICOM names
02008-1: from server, different DICOM mapping






06006-1: difference in names nii files





04001-1: different DICOM mapping
